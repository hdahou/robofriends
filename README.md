My First Project using React. A simple website but one which I found challenging due to new concepts of props, state, error boundaries. Topics I'll be building my knowledge on in the following months.

# Key Takeaways: 

- In React we build components and then build upon these components to build containers. In this case the search box, the cards, the cardlist and the scroll were all components. The app itself was the container.
- We can use state, a plain javascript object, to describe the current components situation. A parent feeds state to the child and the child will then receive props and re-render. To do this we use the this.setState() method.
- When an event occurs in the child component, it will trigger a change in the state object, meaning the component will re-render. 
- We can use JSX in React to allow us to write HTML elements in Javascript. Remember to use className rather than class. 
- We have one way data flow in react from parents to children

TIP: Decide on how to break down to components and structure the application, decide on the state and where it lives, and what changes when the state changes. Doing these 3 things well will make your program as efficient and fast as it can be.

I hope you enjoy looking through this project, and as I gain more experience I'll be making changes and updating.
